# Python-Dashboard
In this project, I used package Dash and Plotly in Python to create an interactive dashboard to display NBA player data.

Data Source: https://s3.amazonaws.com/programmingforanalytics/NBA_data.xlsx

The program performs the following processes:
- Organized and manipulated data by Python to prepare for post-action analysis.
- Explored data to determine dashboard functions for user interaction.
- Designed user interface with Dash and Plotly packages from Python to implement data visualization.
